## Python Virtual Environment

Development and deployment uses the Python virtual environment system. After
cloning the project you will need to create the virtual environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Before interacting with the project the virtual environment will need to be
activated.

```bash
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

## Requirements

After activating the virtual environment you will need to install and upgrade
the project requirements.

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```
